I am a third-year PhD student in the [School of Statistics](https://cla.umn.edu/statistics) at the University of Minnesota. I am advised by [Sara Algeri](https://salgeri.umn.edu/) and [Galin Jones](https://galinj.github.io/). I am a part of the Data Science in Multi-Messenger Astrophysics ([DSMMA](https://dsmma.umn.edu/)) program. 

I spend a lot of time developing statistical procedures to solve challenging problems in astrophysics and high-energy physics. A copy of my [CV](cv_fall_2024.pdf) is here.
