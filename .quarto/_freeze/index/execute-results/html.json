I am advised by [Sara Algeri](https://salgeri.umn.edu/) and [Galin Jones](https://galinj.github.io/). I am a part of the Data Science in Multi-Messenger Astrophysics ([DSMMA](https://dsmma.umn.edu/)) program. \n\nI spend a lot of time developing statistical procedures to solve challenging problems in astrophysics and high-energy physics. A copy of my [CV](cv_fall_2024.pdf) is here. \n\n:::\n\n",
